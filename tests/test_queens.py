# Unit tests for the QueensState class in "queens.py".
#
# Docstrings are not required in your unit tests, though each test does need to have
# a name that clearly indicates its purpose.  Notice, for example, that the provided
# test method is named "test_queen_count_is_zero_initially" instead of something generic
# like "test_queen_count", since it doesn't entirely test the "queen_count" method,
# but instead focuses on just one aspect of how it behaves.  You'll want to do likewise.
